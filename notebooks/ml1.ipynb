    "[Learn Python 3 the Hard Way](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134692888). If you're already a general purpose developer, but with no previous Python background, I recommend this book [Python Tricks: A Buffet of Awesome Python Features](https://www.amazon.es/Python-Tricks-Buffet-Awesome-Features/dp/1775093301). The more familiarity you have with numeric programming in Python, the better. If you're looking to improve in this area, we strongly suggest Wes McKinney's [Python for Data Analysis, 2nd ed](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1491957662/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8).\n",

    "- [Python Machine Learning: Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Machine-Learning-scikit-learn-TensorFlow/dp/1787125939/ref=dp_ob_title_bk): New version of a very successful book. A lot of the new material however covers deep learning in Tensorflow, which isn't relevant to this course\n",
